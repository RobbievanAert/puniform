The p-uniform method is based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. Please note that the method is still in development and that this is a beta version. If you suspect a bug, please send me an email.\nDepends: R (>= 3.1.2)\nLicense: GPL-2\nLazyData: FALSE\nEncoding: UTF-8\nImports:\n  ADGofTest (>= 0.3)\n",
