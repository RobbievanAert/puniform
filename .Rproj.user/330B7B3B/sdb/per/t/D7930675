The p-uniform method is based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size.\n\nPlease note that the method is still in development and that this is a beta version. If you suspect a bug, please send me an email (R.C.M.vanAert@tilburguniversity.edu).\n\nThe paper about the method:\n\nvan Assen, M. A. L. M., van Aert, R. C. M., & Wicherts, J. M. (2014).
