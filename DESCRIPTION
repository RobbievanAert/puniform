Description: The puniform package provides meta-analysis methods that correct for
    publication bias. Three methods are currently included in the package.
    The p-uniform method can be used for estimating effect size,
    testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias.
    The second method in the package is the hybrid method. The hybrid method is a
    meta-analysis method for combining an original study and replication and while
    taking into account statistical significance of the  original study. The
    p-uniform and hybrid method are based on the statistical theory that the distribution
    of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. The third
    method in the package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method.
    This method computes posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no,
    small, medium, and large) based on an original study and replication while
    taking into account publication bias in the original study. The method can
    also be used for computing the required sample size of the replication akin
    to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing. Please note that the
    package is still in development and that this is a beta version. If you
    suspect a bug, please send me an email.
