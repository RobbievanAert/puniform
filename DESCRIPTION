Description: The p-uniform package provides the p-uniform method for estimating effect 
    size, testing the null-hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias.
    The p-uniform method is based on the statistical theory that the distribution
    of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. Another method in         the package is the hybrid method. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method for         combining an original study and replication and while taking into account statistical       significance of the  original study. Please note that the method is still in         development and that this is a beta version. If you uspect a bug, please send me an     email.
