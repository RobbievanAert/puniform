Description: The p-uniform package provides a method for estimating effect
  size, testing the null-hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias. The p-uniform method is based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. Please note that the method is still in development and that this is a beta version. If you suspect a bug, please send me an email.
