#' snapshot
#'
#' Function for applying Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method for two-independent
#' means and raw correlation coefficients.
#'
#' @param m1i A vector of length two containing the means in group 1 for the original
#' study and replication for two-independent means
#' @param m2i A vector of length two containing the means in group 2 for the original
#' and replication for two-independent means
#' @param n1i A vector of length two containing the sample sizes in group 1 for
#' the original study and replication for two-independent means
#' @param n2i A vector of length two containing the sample sizes in group 2 for
#' the original study and replication for two-independent means
#' @param sd1i A vector of length two containing the standard deviations in group 1
#' for the original study and replication for two-independent means
#' @param sd2i A vector of length two containing the standard deviations in group 2
#' for the original study and replication for two-independent means
#' @param ri A vector of length two containing the raw correlation coefficients
#' of the orignal study and replication
#' @param ni A vector of length two containing the sample size of the original 
#' study and replication for the raw correlation coefficient
#' @param tobs A vector of length two containing the t-values of the original
#' study and replication
#' @param alpha An integer specifying the alpha level as used in the original
#' study
#'
#' @details The function computes posterior probabilities (assuming a uniform prior
#' distribution) for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium, and large) based
#' on an original study and replication while taking into account statistical
#' significance in the original study. For more information see van Aert and van
#' Assen (2016).
#'
#' Two different effect size measures can be used as input for the \code{snapshot}
#' function: two-independent means and raw correlation coefficients.
#' Analyzing two-independent means can be done by either providing
#' the function group means (\code{m1i} and \code{m2i}), standard deviations
#' (\code{sd1i} and \code{sd2i}), and sample sizes (\code{n1i} and \code{n2i}) or
#' t-values (\code{tobs}) and sample sizes (\code{n1i} and \code{n2i}). Both options
#' should be accompanied with input for the argument \code{alpha}. See the Example section for
#' an example. Raw correlation coefficients can be analyzed by supplying \code{ri}
#' and \code{ni} to the \code{snapshot} function next to input for the argument
#' \code{alpha}.
#'
#' The \code{snapshot} function assumes that a two-tailed hypothesis test was
#' conducted in the original study. In case a one-tailed hypothesis test was
#' conducted in the original study, the alpha level has to be multiplied by two.
#' For example, if a one-tailed hypothesis test was conducted with an alpha level
#' of .05, an alpha of 0.1 has to be submitted to \code{snapshot}.
#'
#' @return The \code{snapshot} function returns a data frame with posterior probabilities
#' for no (\code{p.0}), small (\code{p.sm}), medium (\code{p.me}), and large (\code{p.la})
#' true effect size.

  ### Posterior probabilities of hypotheses
  p.0 <- f.0/(f.0+f.sm+f.me+f.la)
