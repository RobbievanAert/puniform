README for "puniform" package

The puniform package provides meta-analysis methods that correct for
publication bias or statistically combine an original published study and 
replication when taking into account statistical significance in the original 
published study.

Please note that this package is still under development and that this is a beta 
version. If you suspect a bug, please send me an email (R.C.M.vanAert@tilburguniversity.edu).
