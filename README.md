README for "puniform" package

The puniform package provides meta-analysis methods that correct for
publication bias. Three methods are currently included in the package. 
The p-uniform method can be used for estimating effect size,
testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias.
The second method in the package is the hybrid method. The hybrid method is a
meta-analysis method for combining an original study and replication and while
taking into account statistical significance of the  original study. The
p-uniform and hybrid method are based on the statistical theory that the distribution
of p-values is uniform conditional on the population effect size. The third
method in the package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method.
This method computes posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no,
small, medium, and large) based on an original study and replication while
taking into account publication bias in the original study. The method can
also be used for computing the required sample size of the replication akin
to power analysis in null hypothesis significance testing. 

Please note that this package is still under development and that this is a beta 
version. If you suspect a bug, please send me an email (R.C.M.vanAert@tilburguniversity.edu).
