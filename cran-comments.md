## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the first sentence of the description file. It now starts with "Provides meta-analysis methods..." instead of "This package...".

* Added references to the methods described in the description file.

## Test environments
* Windows 7, R 3.5.0 (local)
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs and WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* New submission

	This is the initial submission of the package.

## Downstream dependencies
I ran reverse dependency checks and all packages passed the checks.
