## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Replaced the class() function with the inherits() function

* Fixed an URL in README.md that was identified as possibly invalid

* Fixed a DOI in DESCRIPTION that was identified as possibly invalid

## Test environments
* Windows 10, R 4.1.3 (local)
* ubuntu 20.04 (GitHub Actions), R 4.1.3
* osx 11 (GitHub Actions), R 4.1.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs and WARNINGs.

## Downstream dependencies
I ran reverse dependency checks and all packages passed the checks.
